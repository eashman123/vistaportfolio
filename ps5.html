                        <h3>Hamlet Essay - Collaboration with Rasa, Joseph, and Ryan</h3>
                        <p>We all know what happens when the ball drops in Time Square: dieting season.
                            People all around the world plan their New Year’s resolution of finally
                            hitting the gym and laying off the junk food. And every year, most plans
                            go one of two ways: people either “plan on starting their diet tomorrow”
                            for around twelve months and then rinse and repeat, or they starve themselves
                            for around two weeks before giving up. In other words, they always either
                            hesitate to act for too long and end up with absolutely no results, or
                            they act too quickly and ultimately end up with no results either. This
                            problem of extrema in action is quite common, and Shakespeare’s characters
                            in
                            <em>Hamlet</em>are no exception to this fault. In the play, Hamlet’s outer
                            persona is one of wit and irrational behavior, whereas his inner persona
                            depicts a pained, introspective man—together, these conflicting natures
                            lead to him to procrastinate his quest for vengeance. Thus, through Hamlet’s
                            psychiatric discrepancies, Shakespeare explores the consequences of acting
                            too soon or not soon enough: there exists a medium in planning action,
                            and when we fall too far towards one end of the spectrum, the results are
                            far from optimal.</p>
                        <p>Hamlet’s public persona stems from his playful wit, which eventually evolves
                            into pure irrationality. His dialogue with significant characters, such
                            as Claudius, Polonius, and Gertrude, reveals his quick-thinking as he speaks
                            with double meanings and convoluted insults. When introduced to Hamlet
                            in the first act, the first line he emits is a subtle insult aimed at King
                            Claudius, stating, “A little more than kin and less than kind,” in which
                            Hamlet disregards Claudius referring to him as both nephew and son and
                            instead expresses his disdain for Claudius (1.2.67). Hamlet’s wordplay
                            on “kin” and “kind” further portrays his restless demeanor, which evolves
                            as the play progresses along with his madness. This is evident once Hamlet
                            has taken on the task of killing Claudius: during the players’ performance,
                            for example, he converses in double entendres—with his sexual advances
                            to lay on Ophelia’s lap and his mockery of Polonius during their talk of
                            the clouds—in his crusade to convince the kingdom of his emotional instability
                            (3.2). However, these passive jabs escalate into full-fledged irrationality.
                            When arguing with his mother, he stabs Polonius, who is hiding behind the
                            curtains, purely due to his extreme emotions, choosing to act on a whim
                            rather than investigate the noise. Immediately after, he holds no regard
                            for Polonius, continuing to yell at his mother instead (3.4). Hamlet’s
                            utter disregard of his actions expose his developing madness, but he still
                            continues with his double-sided riddles, only now being more transparent
                            in his dialogue with Claudius: when asked where he hid Polonius’s body,
                            he simply states that Polonius is at supper and is being eaten by worms,
                            which will be used by a beggar to catch fish to eat. In saying this, Hamlet
                            implicitly threatens Claudius, stating that the king will eventually become
                            grub for the use of beggars. Overall, Hamlet, throughout the play, is a
                            character defined by quick wit and a sharp tongue; as he descends deeper
                            into the pit of madness, these characteristics remain—morphed and amplified
                            by his growing insanity.</p>
                        <p>Although Hamlet’s public persona displays him as an impulsive person,
                            this is in stark contrast to his first soliloquy, where he appears extremely
                            contemplative; he suffers from immense emotional pain and would commit
                            suicide were it not for “His [God’s] canon ’gainst self slaughter” (1.2.136).
                            His logical introspection, however, is first illustrated in his “To Be
                            or Not to Be” soliloquy. During the speech, he finds himself torn between
                            life and death as he weighs both the plausible benefits and potential horrors
                            of committing suicide. He concludes that our thoughts and ideas lead to
                            hesitancy and inaction, making us unable to take the plunge into the unknown
                            (3.1). Moreover, it becomes increasingly evident that his charade of madness
                            assimilates into his real thoughts; as compared to his previous thoughts,
                            such as his plan to re-enact the death of Hamlet Senior in front of Claudius—a
                            logical method of determining his uncle’s guilt—he is now contemplating
                            rash actions, as he now views suicide as “to sleep, perchance to dream”
                            which he previously scorned as a sinful act (3.1.73). Hamlet’s hesitation
                            becomes clear when he approaches Claudius but delays in fulfilling his
                            father’s wishes, stating that the king must die while committing a sin
                            (3.4). Not pursuing the one perfect chance to slay his enemy and postponing
                            it to a later date reiterates the idea that Hamlet will continuously hesitate
                            and falter when presented with the opportunity to execute a course of action.
                            Hamlet’s “deliberation and postponement of decision inhibit [his] action,”
                            thus resulting in excessive amounts of murder and death–tragedies that
                            would have easily been avoided if he had taken action at the appropriate
                            time (Richards 174). Only later, during his soliloquy where he admires
                            Fortinbras invading Poland, does Hamlet—in desperation—move to action,
                            first killing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and later Laertes and Claudius
                            (4.4). Hamlet retains the qualities of introspection and hesitancy throughout
                            the play, yet into his inner self the madness creeps too: his thoughts
                            become more wild, more daring than before.</p>
                        <p>Hamlet’s oscillation between pensiveness and irrationality in his inward
                            and outward persona results in a struggle to avenge his father, revealing
                            Shakespeare’s argument that action must take place in a logical, planned
                            out way—not senselessly or hastily. Hamlet’s juxtaposing personalities
                            result in a depiction of a man both “actor and scholar, lover and avenger,
                            hero and fool,” as described by theatre professor Dr. Robert J. Landy (166).
                            In creating this tension, Shakespeare illustrates that being extreme on
                            either side of the spectrum—reluctancy or rash action—will result in failure,
                            which he further proves through his character foils of Laertes and Fortinbras
                            —Laertes is fast to act and Fortinbras follows a logical plan. Immediately
                            upon hearing of his father’s death, Laertes swiftly acts in setting out
                            to murder Claudius under an assumption that he was his father’s killer,
                            then quickly believes Claudius’ assertion of Hamlet’s guilt. Fortinbras,
                            on the other hand, chooses not to avenge his father through murdering King
                            Hamlet, but strategically invades Poland instead, ultimately gaining control
                            of Denmark. While Hamlet originally had a plan, he waited too long and
                            began to fall astray, ultimately leading to failure; Laertes had no plan,
                            and he fell short of revenge as well. By planning and carrying out planned
                            action, just as Shakespeare believed, Fortinbras alone was able to succeed.</p>
                        <p>Both of Hamlet’s personas—his public irrationality and private hesitancy—conflict
                            throughout the play, resulting in an inability to succeed in his vengeance
                            on King Claudius. He was unable to succeed because he waited too long,
                            hesitating to the point of pure desperation, causing a plethora of unwarranted
                            murders. This failure is exactly why Shakespeare tells us to act on our
                            plans—if we act too irrationally we will only crash and burn, but if we
                            wait too long, nothing positive will come either.
                            <em>Hamlet</em>imparts upon us the necessity to plan—and act on that plan;
                            anything else will not suffice. Be it a New Year’s resolution or vengeance
                            for our father, only a plan—an actionable plan—will lead us in the right
                            direction.</p>

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>This essay was a collaboration with 3 other people, Rasa, Joseph G., and
                        Ryan through an online cloud service called Google Docs. Who wrote what
                        can be viewed
                        <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/fcusd.org/document/d/1r87R8XDHuqY2U0INOBBhNOE5KgUBDE8-nC_nyXcPGoU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. However, this essay does not feel as if it was written by 4 people,
                        each with their individual voices and unique ways of writing. Rather, the
                        essay seems to contain a singular, sophisticated voice. In writing this
                        essay, our group woked together to write each individual sentence. However,
                        members had contradictory ideas of opinions about how to transcribe a certain
                        idea, and these issues were solved through discussing the best and clearest
                        way of conveying the information, and voted on as a group to solve the
                        issue. Thus, each sentence had the combined voice of the people that wrote
                        it, and this resulted in an essay that does not seem to vary in voice from
                        sentence to sentence.</p>
                    <p>This essay shows a mastery of the use of technology to interact and work
                        with others that results in a polished piece of writing that does not betray
                        the act of collaboration to the reader.</p>
