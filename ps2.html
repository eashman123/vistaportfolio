                                and were able to build a bridge across the ocean to Lanka. Every living
                                thing helped in this great endeavor; even squirrels would deposit small

                            <span style="font-weight: 400">I yawned. This was probably the Gazillionth time I had heard this story,
                                and the monotonous speaker and uncomfortable, hard ground I was sitting
                                on crossed-legged in no way helped ease my boredom. I had been dragged
                                to Temple once again by my parents, under the promise that my friends would
                                be there, who, presumably, were dragged there under the same circumstances.</span>
                        </p>

                            <span style="font-weight: 400">I started looking over at my friend, mouthing words to him.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen to the lecture. You can talk with your friends afterwards,” my

                                focus on what the speaker was saying. Instead, I let my thoughts wander,
                                and wondered why any outlandish story such as this, with talking monkeys
                                with god-given abilities, bridges built solely from floating rocks, and
                                a protagonist who wielded arrows more powerful than a nuclear bomb, enchanted

                        <h3>Common Application Essay</h3>
                        <p>
                            <span style="font-weight: 400">“Eashaan, do you put cow eyeballs in that curry you eat every day?” The
                                jeer itself wasn’t particularly aggravating, but it was the repetition—the
                                repetition every single day, to the point where I was called “Curry Boy”—that
                                made third grade and the rest of elementary school intolerable for me.
                                Eventually, I became detached from class, undergoing those seven hours
                                only to complete required work and nothing else, wrapping myself inside
                                the world of books during recess.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span style="font-weight: 400">My whole body felt as if it were on fire. Today, I had left my book in
                                class. Today, I had decided to play a simple game of zombie tag with my
                                classmates. Today, I had ended up laying on the cracked, grey floor of
                                the boy’s bathroom while the other boys celebrated with the final survivor.
                                We both reached the safe zone, the boy’s bathroom, but there could only
                                be one victor. Thus, a short fight ensued—one in which I took the heavy
                                blows. Hours after the fight, I, a puny child with sticks for limbs, was
                                fantasizing winning that fight. And when we passed the Taekwondo Studio
                                on the way home, I asked my mother if I could join. With enough practice,
                                I reasoned, I’d be the one pummeling that kid—and anyone who had teased
                                me—into the ground.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span style="font-weight: 400">As I donned my brand-new uniform and white belt, I felt a surge of energy
                                course through me. The class was difficult: I had to hold up punches and
                                maintain long, awkward stances, my arms and legs screaming in pain. Yet
                                I held out through the pain, knowing that soon, no one would dare mess
                                with me. This was class after class, belt after belt, striving to finally
                                stand up against my bullies—yet never taking action to do so. I doubted
                                whether I could ever really take them on. As my first tournament loomed
                                in the near future, I felt that this would be the perfect test for my readiness.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span style="font-weight: 400">My whole body felt as if it were on fire. My previous match had ended
                                in a horrific clash of legs, and I could already feel the welt swelling
                                on my battered shin. However, I had won my previous match, and I now had
                                to face off in the final match for first place. As the match began, my
                                every movement sent blades up my leg, my teeth clenching so hard that my
                                ears rang. Yet I endured the pain, determined to get first, to prove that
                                I was better. I dodged and blocked, and punched and kicked, every fiber
                                of my being yearning, screaming, for victory. If I won, not only would
                                I triumph against my opponent but also the bullies that had tormented me
                                for years. It was a good thing, then, that I lost.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span style="font-weight: 400">As a white belt, I had to learn the student oath: “I will observe the
                                tenets of Taekwondo, respect instructors and seniors, never misuse Taekwondo,
                                be a champion of freedom and justice, and help build a more peaceful world,
                                Sir.” Originally, I was confused by this statement. How could Taekwondo,
                                a fighting style, be used to promote non-violence? Yet what I came to learn
                                was that Taekwondo wasn’t about building a fighter—it was about building
                                a person. A person who followed that oath and embodied its tenets—courtesy,
                                integrity, perseverance, self-control, and indomitable spirit. Through
                                respecting my instructors I learned courtesy; through accepting defeat
                                I learned integrity; through holding my kick an inch away from my opponent
                                I learned self-control; and through endurance of pain I learned perseverance
                                and indomitable spirit.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span style="font-weight: 400">In my 10 years and 13 belts as a Martial Artist, I have not become the
                                honed fighter I originally envisioned—there are many years of training
                                left for that to become a reality. Instead, I became a better person, learning
                                the importance of connecting with others—not fighting them.</span>
