              <span style="font-weight: 400">“And they wrote Rama’s name on the rocks, which then floated on the water,
                and were able to build a bridge across the ocean to Lanka. Every living
                thing helped in this great endeavor; even squirrels would deposit small
                pebbles to enlarge the bridge, and the great monkey architect Nala oversaw…”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">I yawned. This was probably the Gazillionth time I had heard this story,
                and the monotonous speaker and uncomfortable, hard ground I was sitting
                on crossed-legged in no way helped ease my boredom. I had been dragged
                to Temple once again by my parents, under the promise that my friends would
                be there, who, presumably, were dragged there under the same circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">I started looking over at my friend, mouthing words to him.</span>

              <span style="font-weight: 400">I reluctantly returned my attention to the speaker, but was unable to
                focus on what the speaker was saying. Instead, I let my thoughts wander,
                and wondered why any outlandish story such as this, with talking monkeys
                with god-given abilities, bridges built solely from floating rocks, and
                a protagonist who wielded arrows more powerful than a nuclear bomb, enchanted
                the adults so.</span>

            <h3>Common Application Essay</h3>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">“Eashaan, do you put cow eyeballs in that curry you eat every day?” The
                jeer itself wasn’t particularly aggravating, but it was the repetition—the
                repetition every single day, to the point where I was called “Curry Boy”—that
                made third grade and the rest of elementary school intolerable for me.
                Eventually, I became detached from class, undergoing those seven hours
                only to complete required work and nothing else, wrapping myself inside
                the world of books during recess.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">My whole body felt as if it were on fire. Today, I had left my book in
                class. Today, I had decided to play a simple game of zombie tag with my
                classmates. Today, I had ended up laying on the cracked, grey floor of
                the boy’s bathroom while the other boys celebrated with the final survivor.
                We both reached the safe zone, the boy’s bathroom, but there could only
                be one victor. Thus, a short fight ensued—one in which I took the heavy
                blows. Hours after the fight, I, a puny child with sticks for limbs, was
                fantasizing winning that fight. And when we passed the Taekwondo Studio
                on the way home, I asked my mother if I could join. With enough practice,
                I reasoned, I’d be the one pummeling that kid—and anyone who had teased
                me—into the ground.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">As I donned my brand-new uniform and white belt, I felt a surge of energy
                course through me. The class was difficult: I had to hold up punches and
                maintain long, awkward stances, my arms and legs screaming in pain. Yet
                I held out through the pain, knowing that soon, no one would dare mess
                with me. This was class after class, belt after belt, striving to finally
                stand up against my bullies—yet never taking action to do so. I doubted
                whether I could ever really take them on. As my first tournament loomed
                in the near future, I felt that this would be the perfect test for my readiness.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">My whole body felt as if it were on fire. My previous match had ended
                in a horrific clash of legs, and I could already feel the welt swelling
                on my battered shin. However, I had won my previous match, and I now had
                to face off in the final match for first place. As the match began, my
                every movement sent blades up my leg, my teeth clenching so hard that my
                ears rang. Yet I endured the pain, determined to get first, to prove that
                I was better. I dodged and blocked, and punched and kicked, every fiber
                of my being yearning, screaming, for victory. If I won, not only would
                I triumph against my opponent but also the bullies that had tormented me
                for years. It was a good thing, then, that I lost.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">As a white belt, I had to learn the student oath: “I will observe the
                tenets of Taekwondo, respect instructors and seniors, never misuse Taekwondo,
                be a champion of freedom and justice, and help build a more peaceful world,
                Sir.” Originally, I was confused by this statement. How could Taekwondo,
                a fighting style, be used to promote non-violence? Yet what I came to learn
                was that Taekwondo wasn’t about building a fighter—it was about building
                a person. A person who followed that oath and embodied its tenets—courtesy,
                integrity, perseverance, self-control, and indomitable spirit. Through
                respecting my instructors I learned courtesy; through accepting defeat
                I learned integrity; through holding my kick an inch away from my opponent
                I learned self-control; and through endurance of pain I learned perseverance
                and indomitable spirit.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">In my 10 years and 13 belts as a Martial Artist, I have not become the
                honed fighter I originally envisioned—there are many years of training
                left for that to become a reality. Instead, I became a better person, learning
                the importance of connecting with others—not fighting them.</span>

          <h2>Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">My first essay (10th grade) discusses the topic of my boredom in going
              to temple. My second essay discusses the bullying I experienced in elementary
              school, and what the actions I took to overcome that. Between these two
              essays, there is very clear growth in my ability to write an engaging narrative
              story.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">Firstly, my choice of topic for the first essay is ill-chosen. In writing
              a story about a boring time, the story itself is very boring and bland.
              My choice of topic creates an essay that is not very palatable, and the
              content matches it. A majority of the story is simply dialogue, with the
              first paragraph completely meaningless to anyone foreign to the</span>
            <i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Ramayana</span>
            </i>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">. Furthermore, much of the detail doesn’t describe the scene well: it
              says I’m bored, cross-legged, and have been forced to attend. And the detail
              of me being cross-legged is completely unnecessary in building the setting.
              The only detail that shows my boredom in the story is “I yawned”. Lastly,
              although the last paragraph attempts to create some sort of commentary
              about the situation, about how this repeated story is still interesting
              to the parents yet boring for the children, but stops short and abruptly
              ends. While this essay tells a story, it does so unimaginatively and without
              direction.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">The second essay is much better in creating a story and atmosphere. Although
              both essays begin with quotes, the second essay actually analyzes the meaning
              and impact of the quote. Furthermore, the details are much more immersive.
              “My whole body felt as if it were on fire” shows how much pain I was in.
              Furthermore, by using it twice, first in my confrontation in the bathroom
              and later in my contention for 1st place at a regional taekwondo competition,
              I build a parallel between the two events and their significance to the
              story. And to wrap it all up, this story also has a direction: me learning
              the true meaning and use of Taekwondo: to build a person, not hurt another
              one.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, by narrating a more interesting story, including an underlying meaning,
              and using literary techniques such as parallelism, I have grown my ability
              to tell a story more effectively and enticingly than before.</span>
