            <h3>Ninth Grade Arguementative Essay: No Need for Revenge</h3>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Mark Mathabane, a native South African, was subject to Apartheid. After
                Apartheid was lifted, there was talk of violence against the whites. In</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Cycle of Revenge Can Be Broken</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">, Mathabane writes “Guns, bombs, and tanks cannot defeat hatred. It can
                be vanquished only by humanity”. I agree with his claim, but also think
                that not wanting to do the things done to oneself to other people also
                influences people to be able to overcome hatred and revenge.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Mathabane overcame revenge by seeing the humanity in white people. In</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Cycle of Revenge Can Be Broken</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">, Mathabane tells a story about a nun who cared about his family: “My
                mother had been repeatedly denied a birth certificate for me — a necessary
                document for school registration — because she did not have a permit proving
                that our family had a right to live in Alexandra. But we couldn’t get the
                permit without the birth certificate. My mother asked a white nun for help.
                When she realized the Catch-22 my mother was trapped in, the nun cried.
                I remember being stunned by her tears, for they were the first I’d ever
                seen streak a white face. I remember saying to myself: ”She feels my mother’s
                pain. She’s human after all, not a monster.”” In this story, he saw that
                this white nun had empathy-she cared about him and his problem. This was
                nothing like the white policeman, who were cold, hard, and devoid of empathy.
                He realized that exacting his revenge on all white folk would mean killing
                people like the nun, who cared about black people and were probably against
                Apartheid. Also, if he started killing white people in “white homes, kindergartens,
                shopping centers, schools, buses, and playgrounds”, then wouldn’t he be
                worse than the policeman also killing people?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">By seeing the humanity in people, we can prevent ourselves from having
                to take revenge. In</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">Night</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">, the SS demonstrate human traits when the child is being hung. Elie Wiesel
                writes, “The SS seemed more preoccupied, more worried, then usual…This
                time, the Lagerkapo refused to act as executioner”. These SS were troubled
                over the killing of a child, so they felt guilty and sad. Also the Lagerkapo,
                who had hung many people, didn’t want to kill this child. He felt like
                this was wrong. Sure, they may have just been scared of protests and uprisings
                by the Jews, but nothing had really happened after months of persecution,
                so an uprising was unlikely. When it says they were more preoccupied and
                worried than usual, they may have been feeling guilty and bad for killing
                such an innocent person. They showed their humanity this way, and Wiesel
                and the other prisoners saw and felt this. They didn’t feel like they needed
                to take revenge after they were freed-“And even when we were no longer
                hungry [the hunger that had consumed their lives], there was still no one
                who thought of revenge”. In</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Third Wave</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">, those students were human; the things they were told and practiced were
                not “kill the Jews”. Yet, they were manipulated into doing whatever their
                teacher said. If a high school teacher was able to do this to 200 kids,
                it wouldn’t have been difficult for Hitler, with political power, and good
                speaking skills, to manipulate the German people into doing what he asked.
                They were still human, but they had been manipulated. For those of you
                who disagree I do see that there is a disconnect between these extreme
                experiences, like the Holocaust and Apartheid, and every day, normal things,
                like someone stealing your food.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Not wanting to inflict the pain inflicted onto oneself on other people
                is another way we can resist our desire and one for revenge. In the Oprah
                Special, “Auschwitz Death Camp”, Oprah and Wiesel went to Auschwitz, the
                concentration camp that Wiesel was put in. They had a talk, and at one
                point, Oprah asks if he would have taken revenge on the Nazis. He replied,
                “I don’t want others to suffer like I suffered”. He felt that taking revenge
                would make him as inhumane as the SS and Hitler. If him and other Jews
                took revenge, would they be any better than Nazis? The entire Holocaust
                happened because Hitler blamed Germany’s loss in World War I on the Jews,
                and wanted revenge. Some of you may be thinking, “The Jew should take revenge”.
                If the Holocaust never happened, and the Jews randomly killed innocent
                Germans, (like what the Africans in South Africa could have done after
                Apartheid was lifted), wouldn’t that have been considered evil, horrible,
                and inhumane? But as revenge, acts like this seem acceptable.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">People can quench their thirst for revenge by not wanting to cause the
                pain on others caused to them. Also, revenge can be overcome by, as Mark
                Mathabane writes, “It [hatred] can be vanquished only by humanity”. Hatred
                will only cause more hatred, creating increasingly more and more pain and
                instability for everybody. The only way this cycle can be broken is through
                peace and forgiveness.</span>

            <h3>Eleventh Grade Arguementative Essay: SPACE EXPLORATION: INNOVATOR AND
              CATALYST FOR CHANGE, FORGOTTEN</h3>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">There is nothing more alien to the human race than Space. Everywhere else,
                the human race has been, and has come to understand. In space exists a
                duality: it is vast and dangerous, but simultaneously near and beautiful.
                In the words of fictional Star Trek Captain James T. Kirk, space, indeed,
                is the final frontier. In our country, space exploration is sidelined –
                for every dollar of taxpayer money, only ½ a cent goes towards NASA, while
                38 times that goes to the military (Source C). The innovations and inventions
                credited to the military, although numerous, pale in comparison to what
                NASA has been able to achieve on their paltry budget. NASA has played an
                integral role in our world, and our current way of life would simply not
                exist without them.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps the greatest achievement of space exploration is its instrumental
                role in the development of integrated circuits – the basis of all electronics
                today.Yet many, such as Russell Roberts, argue, “Don’t tell me about all
                the spin-off technologies . . . . Leave the money here on earth.” (Source
                H). However, if not for this invention, our modern digital life would not
                be possible today. Smartphones, flat screen TV’s, and modern computers
                would not exist today. Even household objects, like a simple thermostat,
                would not exist if not for such innovations. That is not the only spin-off
                technology that has benefited us today. Without space exploration there
                would be no satellites – meaning no television, Internet, or even GPS –
                and many of our modern-day comforts would simply not exist. Although current
                research conducted by NASA may seem meaningless for us on Earth, and it
                may feel as if the funding could better spent here on Earth, the innovations
                produced may again revolutionize the way we live.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Many also argue that we should take care of the issues back home before
                attempting to explore space. Margaret McLean, for example, writes, “we
                do not have a very good track record in protecting our planet home”, arguing,
                like many others, that the problems we have at home should be solved before
                we venture out in space, lest we leave future colonies in the same conditions
                we will probably leave Earth (Source E). However, space exploration has
                had a very strong political effect back home. On December 24, 1968, Earthrise
                was taken. It was a picture of the Earth from the Mun. In this image, the
                Earth looked small and fragile – and very, very vunerable. This one picture
                had an influential effect in kickstarting the green movement in the 1970s,
                leading to legislation such as the</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Clean Air Act in 1970, Clean Water Act in 1972, Endangered Species Act
                in 1973, Federal Land Policy and Management Act in 1976, Resource Conservation
                and Recovery Act in 1976, Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, Surface Mining
                Control and Reclamation Act in 1977, and the National Environmental Policy
                Act in 1970, to name the most important. This green movement, strongly
                influenced by</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">Earthrise</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">, also had a worldwide effect – many governments became interested in
                preserving their environment, eventually leading to international initiatives
                such as the Kyoto Protocol, Montreal Protocol, and the founding of the
                United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). If not
                for the Green movement, the world that we live in now could have been a
                much harsher, dangerous place, with pollution running amok in the absence
                of government regulation.</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Michael Collins wrote, “I really believe that if the political leaders
                of the world could see their planet from a distance of, let’s say, 100,000
                miles, their outlook would be fundamentally changed. That all-important
                border would be invisible, that noisy argument suddenly silenced.” (Source
                G). Perhaps not exactly a view from 100,000 miles, but</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">Earthrise</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">was equally influential in shifting people’s – and in turn, politicians’
                – attitudes and views about our home planet.</span>
            </p>
            <p>Space Exploration has stagnated, with governments more likely to pay for
              boosters on warheads than boosters on the next mission to space. But we,
              as a people, must realize the importance and significance of Space Travel,
              not only for its clear benefits, such as a increased knowledge about the
              Universe. But, there are many other benefits that we gain, here on Earth,
              by searching the stars.</p>
