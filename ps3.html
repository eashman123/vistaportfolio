            <h3>Ninth Grade Informative Essay</h3>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Animal Testing is a major ethical issue. Opponents of animal testing argue
                that it is inhumane and inaccurate to use animals for tests. They also
                suggest using alternatives for animals. Supporters of animal testing argue
                that medical research is dependent on animals, and alternatives are not
                as viable.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">According to an article in The Parliament Magazine written by Emily McIvor,
                a policy director for Humane Society International’s (HSI) research and
                toxicology department, the US food and drug administration estimates that
                nine out of ten drugs that appeared to work in animals fail in humans.
                This is a high failure rate:</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">90%</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Kara Rogers, Ph.D. in pharmacology and toxicology, and Britannica’s life
                science editor, wrote a report on the dangers and inaccuracy of animal
                testing in Britannica’s “Advocacy for Animals”. She writes, “The conditions
                under which laboratory animals are kept can influence and alter experimental
                results”. This is not good in science. In science, you want everything
                to be a constant but one variable, in this case, the drug. Having more
                than one variable, the animal’s living conditions, makes the trial results
                less accurate.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Colin Blakemore, professor of neuroscience at Oxford and Warwick Universities,
                and former head of the Medical Research Council, wrote in an article in
                The Telegraph about animal testing. He writes that we have practically
                the same genes as rats and mice, so we are very closely related. He says
                that their bodies respond to illnesses and treatments much like ours. This
                is in stark contrast with McIvor’s article, which claimed that animal testing
                is highly inaccurate.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">He also writes about our need for animal testing. “A</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">nimal research has contributed to 70 per cent of Nobel prizes for physiology
                or medicine. Without it, we would – medically speaking – be stuck in the
                Dark Ages.” This shows our dependence on animal testing to give us new
                medicines. According to this article, medicines such as antibiotics, insulin,
                and HIV treatment, were all developed with testing on animals.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Another proponent of animal testing is Steven Rose, the author of award
                winning book, “The Making of Memory”. His book is about human brain function
                and memory, where he used chicks for tests. In an excerpt, he defends his
                use of animals in test. He writes about how animal rights activist say
                that animals are very much like humans, and should have rights, but also
                say that animals are too different from humans for animal testing to reliably
                predict what a drug will do in humans.</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">This statement contradicts itself. Where is the line between similarities
                and differences?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">What if we could stop this debate by using something other than living
                things altogether? We now have access to many alternatives to animal testing.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">According to Rogers and McIvor, we can use synthesized human cells and
                organs, computational models and algorithms, and vitro, which are cell
                cultures in a test tube, testing. According to their articles, these alternatives
                are more accurate than animals. Why don’t we use these instead of animals
                if they are better?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">To answer this question, Colin Blakemore says,</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">“Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI]</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">, computer models and work on isolated tissues and cell cultures can be
                useful; but they cannot provide the answers that animal research can.”
                Things like Rose’s research on the brain cannot be emulated on any of the
                alternatives proposed above; he needs to use a brain, and a brain needs
                a living thing to work.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">According to Blakemore, when alternatives are viable, they are always
                used instead of animals because it is required by law. But medical scientists
                still have to use animals depending on their field. If we can’t (yet) stop
                animal testing, should we abstain from using some animals? As Steven Rose
                writes, “How far are those rights to be extended…to ‘animals’? Cats and
                dogs, mice and monkeys, slugs and lice, wasps and mosquitoes are all animals…
                Does an ant have as many rights as a gorilla?”</span>

              <b>Duties and Responsibilities</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Aerospace Engineers: coordinate the designing, manufacturing, and testing
                of aircraft and space vehicles, assess project proposals for their feasibility
                and safety, evaluate designs for their ability to meet industry standards,
                customer requirements, government laws, and (what my interviewee mainly
                did) inspect damaged products to identify problems and possible solutions.
                Aerospace Engineers work on Space flight (Spacecraft, Rockets, Satellites),
                Sub-space flight (Airplanes, Helicopters, Missiles), and Aerodynamics (Design
                of External Vehicle Surfaces).</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Working Environment</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Since Aerospace engineers are employed primarily in analysis and design,
                manufacturing, and research and development, they are usually not out in
                the field, unless to test in the field. Aerospace Engineers usually work
                in offices most of th time, therefore, running simulations on computers
                or designing things on computers. They can also work with wind tunnels,
                but again, most of that work is through computers. Since Aerospace Engineering
                is a high-tech field, Aerospace Companies usually operate in urban or suburban
                areas, not rural ones.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Options for Specialization</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">This career has many options for specialization. Two different degree
                paths that can be taken are Astronautical Engineering, which focuses solely
                on space flight and Aeronautical Engineering, which focuses solely on sub-space
                flight. Within these fields however, Aerospace Engineers can choose to
                work on Aerodynamics, which is the design of external surfaces, Materials
                Selection, which is choosing appropriate materials, Propulsion Systems
                Design and Innovation (with propulsion systems such as Rockets, Turbines,
                Ion Engines etc.),</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">and Guidance Systems, which my interviewee worked mainly on.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Demand</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">The projected job growth for Aerospace Engineering is a decrease by 2%
                from 2014 to 2024, which means the job market will go from 72,500 to 70900
                in the United States in the next 10 years. This means that it is going
                to be harder to get a job in the Aerospace Sector in the next decade. As
                this is a job that requires a lot of very specific and specialized technology,
                as the number of errors that can be made while making aerospace components
                is very low (a small problems radically increases at very high speeds),
                and the specialized technology and required materials are not available
                in a rural setting, and thus must take place in developed, urban areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Salary</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">The median starting salary is $70,000 per year, according to Payscale.
                The mid-career median salary is $108,000 per year, according to the Bureau
                of Labor Statistics.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Education</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">UC Davis is a local public school that offers a degree in the field of
                Aerospace, but schools around the country from MIT to Georgia Tech include
                degrees in Aerospace Science. In comparing MIT and UC Davis, one is substantially
                cheaper than the other, while MIT has a higher ROI on their degrees. However,
                both are great schools with strong Aerospace programs. However, UC Davis
                is in California and is blessed with Californian weather, while students
                at MIT have to deal with horrible East Coast weather. Furthermore, workloads
                at MIT in this field greatly exceed workloads at UC Davis, as MIT has a
                much more rigorous course load, with a much higher weekly course load–around
                50 hours. A Bachelor’s degree is required, but going for higher level degrees
                is recommended.</span>

          <h2>Analysis</h2>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400">My first essay (9th grade) is an informative piece discussing the ethics of animal testing. The second essay (12th grade) is a job description about Aerospace Engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both essays do well in being appropriate to task, purpose, and audience. The first is supposed to be a news article, and is thus unbiased and written at a relatively low reading level. The second essay provides an unbiased breakdown of a career in Aerospace Engineering so the audience can quickly familiarize themselves with the career, and decide on their own whether this field of study interests them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, while the second essay does a good job of simply providing the facts, my ninth grade essay seemed to ask more questions than it answers, with three paragraphs-including the last one-concluding with a question. This muddles the content of the essay somewhat, and makes the essay less clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So although my essays show mastery in correctly addressing the purpose and audience, I have grown in my ability to, for informative pieces, keep it strictly informative.</span></p>
