            <h3>Of Ancient Greeks and Modern Men - Written in a Day</h3>
            <p>Ursula K. Le Guin, award-wining author, wrote, in her book,
              <em>The</em>
              <i>Dispossessed</i>, “Nothing is yours. It is to use. It is to share.” Such
              a statement rings very true today, especially in our modern digital age,
              where information is sent and shared around the world. In this modern age,
              Plato and Aristotle’s views have fallen short, but Sartre’s view on ownership
              have hit the mark, with ownership becoming less about owning a physical
              object and more about the lasting effects is has long after it ceases to
              exist.</p>
            <p>In our digital age, our “things” has shifted from the tangible – real
              objects – to the intangible – information stored by ones and zeroes. With
              the advent of this new age, ownership has also shifted. No longer does
              buying something mean you own it; even after buying it, that software is
              still property owned by those who created it; you only own the skills or
              memories that come out of that software. That Spanish learning program
              you bought really isn’t yours, but the lessons and skills you have learned
              through it still are. Similarly, pirates – people who illegally obtain
              and share software – are still able to reap its benefits in the same way
              as those who purchased that software, making ownership a more confusing
              idea than before – ownership,
              <em>without ownership</em>, is now possible.</p>
            <p>However, the ideas of Plato and Aristotle still contain a nugget of truth
              – their relationship between ownership and morals. Whether is be owning
              a house or owning some skills, the relationship of ownership and morals
              still exists, albeit in a more complex form. Plato’s belief that “owning
              objects is detrimental to a person’s character”, and Aristotle belief that
              “ownership of tangible goods helps to develop moral character” are both
              applicable in the twenty-first century. In some ways, it is obvious: software
              meant to hack – such as RATS, password crackers, or penetration-based Linux
              distros – are used immorally, and are detrimental to morals, while other
              software, like FreeRice – an application that donates 10 grains of rice
              to those in need everytime you answer a question correctly – clearly builds
              morals. However, some software can both build and destroy morals – without
              even having to use it. The process of obtaining software – either buying
              the software from those who worked hard to develop it, or downloading it
              off websites such as ThePirateBay – can build or destroy morals. Buying
              the software, and helping those developers who worked hundreds of hours
              to create it, builds character, while pirating it – and leaving those developers
              unrewarded* – destroys character, and leads to this behavior again. Ownership,
              even in this digital age, still impacts morals, although its relationship
              with ownership existing in a duality that Plato and Aristotle had never
              forseen.</p>
            <p>Ownership – with the possibility to share and copy it – has become more
              confusing and complicated than it was at the time of Plato and Aristotle.
              In their argument about how ownership changes someone, Aristotle and Plato
              – due to the time they lived in – did not consider how ownership is not
              only fluid, but also a label that can apply to things both tangible and
              not, although their core ideas on ownership’s impact on morals are still
              ring true. However, Sartre was able to foresee the fluidity of ownership,
              and develop his ideas around that concept. Ownership is no longer defined
              by the objects or software that are owned, but rather by the abstract things,
              like memories and skills. it leaves behind. In our modern age, these memories
              and skills define our character, not the the objects from which they are
              derived.</p>

            <h3>Classic Literature Research Essay - Written over a month</h3>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">A renowned work of art is exquisitely crafted: each brushstroke meticulously
                applied onto the canvas in an eloquent translation from mind to material.
                Classic pieces of literature, too, share this level of detailed craft.
                However being admitted into the ranks of the literary canon are more stringent
                than just having the quality of being well-written. Classic literature
                also has to contain a universal and timeless theme, be relatable and open
                to many interpretations, and innovate on the genre in novel ways. Furthermore,
                many classic books are old, and thus fit the cliche of being “tested and
                true”, but this is not necessary for a novel to be a classic.</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">, by Tim O’Brien, is a relatively recent novel, but deserves to be called
                a classic in its own right. It is an exquisitely crafted book, contains
                a universal theme about war, and does so while creating a commentary about
                the genre in which it is written—the war story. Thus,</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">is a novel well deserving of a spot in the literary canon.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">O’Brien has crafted his novel with extreme care. In</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">, each word holds powerful meaning and so does each comma and quotation
                mark.</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">, as one would guess, is about the things that the soldiers in the Vietnam
                War carried, the clothing, the guns, the bullets, etc. and their weights.
                But these physical weights are all described in the first chapter of the
                book. The rest of the book, then describes the emotional weight of the
                war on the soldiers. While O’Brien does do this through plot, such as having
                a soldier shoot a dog out of boredom, he also illustrates this emotional
                weight through his diction and syntax. Through sentences as simple as “They
                made themselves laugh” show how actions that are spontaneous and relaxing—through
                the use of “made”—become anything but (O’Brien 14). Furthermore, O’Brien
                sometimes chooses to utilize or omit punctuation when writing the spoken
                words of a character. He does so to “enhance the unconventionality of his
                writing” while creating a wholly unique style of penmanship, innovating
                writing itself, not just his genre (Evans 208). But</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">does not only contain elements of prose, but also contains poetic elements,
                such as consonance and meter. In doing so, he creates an</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">anaphora</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">, where these words receive the most stress, and therefore the most attention
                (Evans 212). This use of anaphora is evident when O’Brien discusses the
                soldiers’ cowardice: “They carried the common secret of cowardice barely
                restrained” where both the “kuh” sound and the “rrr” sound are repeated
                and stressed due to the rhythm created (O’Brien 14). In the sentence preceding,
                O’Brien uses meter when listing out emotions: Grief, terror, love, longing.
                Here, the first two adjectives are negative, and the next two are positive;
                they invoke opposite emotion (O’Brien 14). The meter follows this as well:
                “two accented syllables followed by an unaccented syllable (“grief, terror”),
                which are balanced by two more accented syllables followed by another unaccented
                syllable (“love, longing”)” (Evans 211). His explicit meaning is matched
                and intensified by his use of meter. It is no surprise, then, that “O’Brien’s
                prose is often praised as effectively ‘rhythmic’“ (Evans 212). These are
                one of many ways that O’Brien employs to create such a detailed and impactful
                world that amplify the novel’s meaning. In fact, every example of O’Brien’s
                craft in this paragraph was from one page of his book. With such density
                of craft,</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">is undoubtedly a literary masterpiece, and deftly fulfils this requirement
                of a classic.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">Being a classic is more than just good writing: a classic must contain
                a timeless theme. The theme of</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">is deeply rooted within the truth of war and war stories. In the novel,
                O’Brien outright states “A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct,
                nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor
                restrain men from doing the things men have always done” for a heroic war
                story “very old and terrible lie” (O’Brien 43). War, according to O’Brien,
                is the very essence of evil and obscenity, and ‘true’ war stories only
                attempt to cover that up. Human nature will never change, and thus the
                ideas of this—the ideas about war itself—will always remain relevant. It’s
                the same reason anti-war songs from the cold war still ring true today—war
                has stayed the same, and has been from the beginning of human history.
                Yet this is something that many classics already discuss. But</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">goes further. O’Brien analyzes the genre of the war story as “he examines
                the process of writing one….the medium becomes the message” (Calloway).
                Such a process is wholly unique, as it arguably erects a theme that contends
                with the nature of fiction itself. Indeed, by saying “In many cases a true
                [non-fiction]war story cannot be believed”, and using fiction as the vessel
                of his story, he champions Fiction as the only true way of telling an honest
                account of war. Thus, the theme is universal, while also innovating on
                the genre, especially by criticising other war stories for their flaws.
                Thus,</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">proves to be more than just another book about the oversaturated topic
                of war, by taking a new, fresh perspective. The novel is many things at
                once: “part novel, part collection of stories, part essays, part journalism;
                it is, more significantly, all at the same time” (Calloway).Thus, the themes
                in the book—about suffering and the essence of war stories— will live on
                well after war itself is eradicated. While war never changes, the typical
                war story—through O’Brien’s influence—surely will.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">However, a novel can have an incredibly sophisticated and timeless theme,
                but be relevant and relatable to anyone, not just an English major or a
                war veteran. Outside literary circled, the book even has uses in fields
                such as psychology. Frank Hassebrock, a psychology professor, discussed
                in a college journal how he uses</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">in his classroom. Hassebrock wrote that “psychological research presented
                by Schacter readily shows that our memories are easily influenced by many
                factors and that memory errors occur frequently” and tied it O’Brien’s
                description in</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">how “it’s difficult to separate what happened from what seemed to happen.
                What seems to happen becomes its own happening and has to be told that
                way. When a guy dies,…you look away and then look back for a moment and
                then look away again. The pictures get jumbled; you tend to miss a lot”
                (O’Brien 44).</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">is not limited to collegiate studies, and O’Brien states exactly that.
                In an interview on the PBS Newshour with Jeffrey Brown, O’Brien states,
                “I certainly wasn’t aiming at a high school or a collegiate audience.”</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">is different than many war stories and fiction overall. It leaves us guessing
                upon the validity of the stories within: whether O’Brien really did kill
                a man—he first states he killed a man, then later states he watched someone
                else do it—or whether one of his friends truly did kill himself after coming
                to the states, etc. This confusion and ambiguity is intentional. It blurs
                the line between being separate from the events and experiencing them first
                hand. O’Brien, by his own admission, stated “By telling stories, you objectify
                your own experience. You separate it from yourself. You pin down certain
                truths. You make up others. You start sometimes with an incident that truly
                happened, like the night in the shit field, and you carry it forward by
                inventing incidents that did not in fact occur but that nonetheless help
                to clarify and explain. (O’Brien 101). Thus, this book is more than a book:
                it is a simulation of a soldier in war. O’Brien makes the reader feel what
                is happening rather than just read it, claiming that “story-truth is truer
                sometimes than happening-truth”, and that, in a war story, what one feels
                is more important than what actually happened (O’Brien 115). Furthermore,
                by categorizing it a fiction,</span>
              <i>
                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">allows readers a vicarious experience of war, one in which we can experience
                the raw emotions of the war by avoiding the emotional shield and numbness
                that a ‘true’ war story—categorized non-fiction—creates. Doing so in</span>

                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">makes the pain only hit harder. Lastly, this is all tied up nicely with
                “</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">O’Brien’s fidelity to detail…that helps create the ‘reality’ of Vietnam
                for readers.” (Chattarji). Indeed, O’Brien intended “</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">go beyond war and to really write a book about…your life or the life of
                a mortician or a housewife or a stockbroker” (Brown). Thus,</span>

                <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
              </i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">is able to pull the reader in and offer many different interpretations,
                and by immersing the reader within the story, makes the central theme only
                more powerful and heavy. For a book that does not elicit emotion or reaction
                can not be classified as a classic, but</span>

              <span style="font-weight: 400">is an eloquent book that is well crafted, contains a universal meaning
                while retaining a social commentary about war and war stories that will
                continue ringing true for centuries and influence future novels. Furthermore,
                It pushes the boundaries of a “true” war story and provides many different
                lenses for their interpretation of that meaning. For these reasons,</span>

          <h2>Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">The first essay was written in about an hour. It is a philosophical argument
              about which school of thought on ownership is correct today: Plato, Aristotle,
              or Sartre. With such a short time period, this essay was not researched
              and is mainly arguments based on given facts, such as the idea of piracy.
              The second essay was formed over the process of a month, but written in
              2 weeks. It is an argument for including</span>
            <i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400">The Things They Carried</span>
            </i>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">in the literary canon, and was heavily researched. Its works cited includes
              multiple long scholarly papers about the novel. Each essay shows mastery of being able to write in different time frames
              with different requirements.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">The first essay shows mastery in writing over short periods of time, no
              doubt aided by my constant procrastination which leads to many of my essays
              being written in a single sitting. It argues a philosophical stance by
              pulling from the real world–showing my understanding of the fundamental
              connection between philosophy and the real world, and therefore an understanding
              of my purpose (in arguing a philosophy) and my audience (other arguing
              about philosophy).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">The second essay shows mastery in writing over a long period of time.
              It began with research in early November, and was completed in December.
              This was also one of the longest essays I have written in High School.
              In being longer, the essay also has to provide more information about the
              topic, and it does so by seamlessly pulling from a variety of scholarly
              sources. It is also much more refined, as the greater time allotment allows
              for a clearer, more polished response to the topic and revision of vocabulary,
              syntax, and structure.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400">Through the frequent weekly prompts last year and this year, I have mastered
              the ability to write in short sittings and also mastered the ability to
              write longer essays over a longer time period through the out-of-class
              essays in every English class I have taken at Vista.</span>
